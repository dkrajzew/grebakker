# Download and Installation

__grebakker__ is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) script. To run it, you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. If you have not installed [Python](https://www.python.org/), yet, please read instructions on installing [Python](https://www.python.org/) first (see below).


## Installing grebakker for Python

The current version is [grebakker-0.4.2](https://github.com/dkrajzew/grebakker/releases/tag/0.4.2).

You have different options for installing __grebakker__.

### Installing the package from PyPi

You may __install grebakker__ using

```console
python -m pip install grebakker
```

You may consider building a virtual environment, first.

You may then run __grebakker__ using 

```console
grebakker
```

This will install __grebakker__ as a script that may be directly called on the command line as well as the [Python](https://www.python.org/) module which you may import using ```import grebakker```.

### Cloning the repository

You may __clone the repository__ which is available at [grebakker&apos;s github page](https://github.com/dkrajzew/grebakker).

```console
git clone https://github.com/dkrajzew/grebakker.git
cd grebakker
```

You may then run __grebakker__ using 

```console
python grebakker/grebakker.py
```

Please note that the current repository version may be an in-between version with new, undescribed, or even buggy behaviour. You should rather use a recent version.

### Download the latest release

Besides, you may __download the current source code release__ here:

* [grebakker-0.4.2.zip](https://github.com/dkrajzew/grebakker/archive/refs/tags/0.4.2.zip)
* [grebakker-0.4.2.tar.gz](https://github.com/dkrajzew/grebakker/archive/refs/tags/0.4.2.tar.gz)

You will get the complete copy of the repository which you have to decompress. A folder named ```grebakker-0.4.2``` will be generated. __grebakker.py__ is stored in the ```grebakker``` folder.

You may run __grebakker__ using 

```console
python grebakker/grebakker.py
```


## Installing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted programming language. For running __grebakker__ and other scripts written in Python you have to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) itself, first.

For installing [Python](https://www.python.org/), use an installer for your system from <https://www.python.org>.

You should as well install **pip**, a package manager for [Python](https://www.python.org/). After installing [Python](https://www.python.org/), you should be able to install **pip** using:

```console
python get-pip.py
```

You may upgrade pip using:

```console
pip install --upgrade pip
```
